# üñ• Windows XPortfolio - A Windows XP Inspired Portfolio Website

#### üîó Live Demo ‚û° [Windows XPortfolio](https://Joris-Grvl.github.io/windows-xportfolio)


![Demo](./Assets/Demo/demo.gif)

I‚Äôm excited to share a personal project I‚Äôve been working on: a **portfolio website designed as a replica of the Windows XP experience**. </br> This project was built entirely using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** ‚Äî no frameworks, just pure frontend technologies.

**Main features** included in the Website :
- Boot screen with loading animation 
- Logon screen with user selection 
- Fully Interactive Windows XP-style desktop environment
- Fully functional Start Menu 
- Classic Windows XP applications (Paint, Notepad, Minesweeper...)  
- Windows sounds, tooltips, and retro icons

While this version is already functional and nostalgic, there are still a few elements missing:
* Some **tooltips on the logon screen**
* Iconic **logon warnings**, like antivirus alerts or system popups
* Some Windows XP applications

I plan to build a couple of dedicated websites inside the Internet Explorer application to showcase the **professional projects I've contributed to throughout my career**, similar to how I integrated my LinkedIn page. For now, I‚Äôm publishing this as an initial version to serve as my portfolio, even if it‚Äôs not yet fully complete.

This project was a nostalgic deep dive into one of the most iconic operating systems ever made, combining design, frontend development, and a touch of creativity to bring a familiar environment to life on the web.
